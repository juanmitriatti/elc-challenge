# Next.js Food Truck Locator

Welcome to the Next.js Food Truck Locator project! This application helps users find the nearest food truck location based on their current location. The project utilizes Next.js, React, and Google Maps API to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users.

## Overview

In this project, I've implemented a feature where users can locate the nearest food truck to their current location. The application utilizes a CSV file located at \`assets/data.csv\`, which contains multiple food truck locations. Upon loading the application, users are prompted to allow access to their location. Once granted, users can click on the "Get Nearest" button to display a line on the map connecting their current location to the closest food truck.

## Features

- **User Location**: The application requests access to the user's location to provide accurate results.
- **CSV Data**: Food truck locations are stored in a CSV file located at \`assets/data.csv\`.
- **Interactive Map**: The map interface powered by Google Maps API allows users to visualize their location and the nearest food truck.
- **Get Nearest**: Users can click on the "Get Nearest" button to display a line connecting their current location to the closest food truck on the map.
